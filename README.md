Story:
-Characters
=Seam
==Top of the class magic student, meets Jevil, talented deliquent. Seam travels with Jevil to keep checks on him, trying to influence him. They end up influencing each other and forms a bond. They eventually make a name for themselves and then get picked up to be court made and court jester. 
Later in service, the "knight" eventually comes and overthrows the kingdom. Before/during that time Jevil has a run-in of sorts with 
---

-Dialogue
Guideline: The dialogue should show Seam slowly going "crazy".

=Pre fight
==The party approaches Seam with Jevilsknife, with the intent of simply following up with him after your fight with Jevil. Before presenting it, someone in your party makes an off-hand comment about it being "odd". You present what he drops, the knife, and he takes it to insepct it, and then starts talking about some memories that it brings up. This transitions into Seam showing what it can do, which begins the fight.

Pretext
The gang walks back to Seam's shop after defeating Jevil. Ralsei seems concerned.

Ralsei
Susie, do you really think it's a good idea to show the *Jevilsknife* to Seam? 

Susie
Don't be such a wimp, it's just a knife. And an axe is just a bigger knife.

Ralsei
I don't know, it doesn't feel right. Like it's-

Seam
Are you going to be mumbling around for longer, or did you want to show me something?

Susie
Here ya old bag, we took care of it.

*Susie hands over the *Jevilsknife* to Seam*

Seam
Hee hee, well what do we have here?
...
Jevil and I used to do all kinds of things together... before he turned. All kinds of nonsense. It's a shame that it ended this way. I think about it from time to time. I miss those days. (REVISE)
...
You know, this thing looks like a knife, but it was actually used all the time as a part of Jevil's old routine.

Ralsei
Oh really? ᵇᵉᶜᵃᵘˢᵉ ᶦᵗ ʰᵘʳᵗ ˡᶦᵏᵉ ᵃ ᵏⁿᶦᶠᵉ

Seam
Yes, it's more of a magician tool rather than a weapon. I could show you what it can do if you like. 

Ralsei
Kris, it seems like Seam is kinda bummed about this whole situation. Might be nice to see what he has.

Kris (options)
A. Let's cheer him up!
B. I don't know, we are kinda busy...

+fight starts+

=Trick phase
Seam is sentimental and exposits more about his past while he does trick after trick. Some points relate more to the specific trick, others less. 
Ralsei and the gang are encouraged that Seam is feeling better, but towards the end the party brings up concern as Seam transitions into heftier moves.

=Hat phase
When Seam puts the hats on the party, the party is very concerned and brings up off-hand comments about how he might be going too far. Seam no longer talks about his sentimental moments. At the end of this phase, Ralsei "snaps" and puts his foot down and calls out his behavior. Seam stops for a second and shows clear signs of him loosing it and going all the way. He says something as he transitions into the last phase.

=Magic phase
Ralsei expresses that Seam needs to be stopped. Seam says crazy nonsense, possibly related to things Jevil says. Maybe even easter eggs.

---
-Battle script
=Basic + Trick Phase
Seam throws out basic attacks (throws card suits at your, reminiscent of Jevils basics). As dialogue begins (maybe a couple rounds of basics), he begins throwing out trick attacks (waterfall shuffle, sword attack, thread/needle, cat's cradle??). Eventaully he throws out the hat trick mechanic.

==Hat Trick
During Seam's phase, he summons hats and steals one of your party members and hides underneath one. During this, he still throws out trick attacks at you. Every hat trick session will give the player, Kris, a set of 'n' joint ACTS that change based off of your missing party member. 1 will hint your missing member's location, 1 will hint at Seam's location, and the rest will do nothing. Hat tricks are triggered by amount of turns passed.
===Hitting your teammate causes a reshuffle and they take damage.
===Hitting an empty hat causes a reshuffle.
===Hitting Seam is a success, damages Seam, and ends the hat trick.
*If you do not act during the first hat trick to reveal, you will always get it wrong.

=Magic Phase
At the end of Seam trick phase (time gated), the fight pauses and Seam expounds. An animation plays showing his transformation, and the introduction of his TP bar. During this phase, seam will throw out a new set of attacks, all related to 'real' magic.

==Seam's TP bar
His TP bar starts at 100%. The bar depletes as he throws out more attacks. The attacks thrown, as well as their TP amounts are hard coded, though some attacks are more expensive than others. At 0% TP, Seam will do *something* to refill his gauge to ???% and then release his "limit break".
"something" = Jevilsknife???

After his final attack, the UI dissapears and he does a final exposition. You win :).
