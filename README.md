=Seam
==Top of the class magic student, meets Jevil, talented deliquent. Seam travels with Jevil to keep checks on him, trying to influence him. They end up influencing each other and forms a bond. They eventually make a name for themselves and then get picked up to be court made and court jester. 
Later in service, the "knight" eventually comes and overthrows the kingdom. Before/during that time Jevil has a run-in of sorts with

-Battle script
=Basic + Trick Phase
Seam throws out basic attacks (throws card suits at your, reminiscent of Jevils basics). As dialogue begins (maybe a couple rounds of basics), he begins throwing out trick attacks (waterfall shuffle, sword attack, thread/needle, cat's cradle??). Eventaully he throws out the hat trick mechanic.

==Hat Trick
During Seam's phase, he summons hats and steals one of your party members and hides underneath one. During this, he still throws out trick attacks at you. Every hat trick session will give the player, Kris, a set of 'n' joint ACTS that change based off of your missing party member. 1 will hint your missing member's location, 1 will hint at Seam's location, and the rest will do nothing. Hat tricks are triggered by amount of turns passed.
===Hitting your teammate causes a reshuffle and they take damage.
===Hitting an empty hat causes a reshuffle.
===Hitting Seam is a success, damages Seam, and ends the hat trick.
*If you do not act during the first hat trick to reveal, you will always get it wrong.

=Magic Phase
At the end of Seam trick phase (time gated), the fight pauses and Seam expounds. An animation plays showing his transformation, and the introduction of his TP bar. During this phase, seam will throw out a new set of attacks, all related to 'real' magic.

==Seam's TP bar
His TP bar starts at 100%. The bar depletes as he throws out more attacks. The attacks thrown, as well as their TP amounts are hard coded, though some attacks are more expensive than others. At 0% TP, Seam will do *something* to refill his gauge to ???% and then release his "limit break".

After his final attack, the UI dissapears and he does a final exposition. You win :).
